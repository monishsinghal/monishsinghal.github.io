I am Monish Singhal, a computer science sophomore at IIIT Hyderabad.

My current interests include theoretical computer science, logic, cryptography, systems and computer architecture. I am looking to explore ideas in machine learning, computer graphics, quantum computing and computer vision.

I also enjoy watching (and playing sports), reading books and discussing random things.
